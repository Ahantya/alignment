Whether you're feeling low and need some comfort, or are just looking to curl up on the couch with a buddy while you get caught up on Bridgerton (or crack open that hot new beach read!), the best lap dogs will be right there when you need them. Dog lovers know that while big, beautiful poochies like mastiffs tend to be great guard dogs, small dogs that like to love up on their humans fulfill an equally important need: cuddly companionship. If you're thinking of adding a lap dog to the family, we've rounded up some favorite breeds, including pugs, Italian greyhounds, shih tzus, and more.
Some are wonderful with littles, others are a dream to train, but all share one trait in common—they're super-affectionate little sweeties that live for snuggles. For many, their adoring nature is actually by design, according to Embark Veterinary Geneticist Dr. Jenna Dockweiler, DVM, DACT. "Many smaller breeds, especially those in the AKC’s Toy group, were bred specifically for companionship," she says. "This means that, over many generations, these breeds have become excellent pets and cuddlers!"
Below, you'll find 17 of the best lap dog breeds to consider if you're looking for a new best friend, including important information about grooming and exercise needs, history, health issues, and personality traits. It's everything you need to know to help you zero in on a doggo...or two...or three. But before you start dialing the nearest breed rescue, be sure to head over to our dog adoption tips so you can make Rover's transition to your home as smooth as possible!
